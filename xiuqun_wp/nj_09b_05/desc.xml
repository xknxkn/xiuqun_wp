Are you a big bookworm who is fond of Mark Twain? He is famous for his stories about Tom Sawyer and his best friend Huckleberry Finn. The character of Tom was based on Mark’s own childhood, while that of Huckleberry Finn was shaped after his best pal, Tom Blankenship.
Not only did he write fun books, but also the author led a very interesting life. He was an inventor, with patents (专利) on a self-adjusting vest strap (可自我调节的有肩带的背心), a history game to improve memory and a self-pasting scrapbook (可自动黏贴的剪贴簿). Unfortunately, the first two were way ahead of their time and the only one that brought him some money was the scrapbook.
Twain was also one of the passengers aboard the first “luxury cruise (豪华游轮)” to Europe, an active man who fought for equality (平等), and an amazing lover of cats. It is said that at one time, he owned as many as 19 of them.
Mark’s books are often described as the foundation of American literature. You can choose some of his books to read if you are interested!
