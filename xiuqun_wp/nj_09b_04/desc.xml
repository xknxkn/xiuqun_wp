Are you a big fan of Doctor Who? This year marks (标志) the 50th anniversary of Doctor Who, which is a British science fiction television series. 
The sci-fi television series tells the adventures of Time Lord—a time-travelling, humanoid alien (具有人类特点的外星人) known as the Doctor. He explores the universe in his “Tradis,” a time-travelling spaceship. It appears as a blue British police box (警亭), which was a common sight in Britain in 1963 when the series was first broadcast. Along with his friends, the Doctor faces a variety of enemies while working to save civilisation (文明), help ordinary people and right wrongs (伸张正义). 
A children's author called Eoin Colfer is writing a new series of Doctor Who short stories. His Doctor Who stories will feature (以……为主角) the first ever Doctor, played on TV by William Hartnell from 1963 to 1966. Other children's authors will also write stories in 2013 to celebrate Doctor Who's 50th anniversary.
To mark the 50th anniversary of the sci-fi series, Royal Mail (皇家邮政) has launched a special set of Doctor Who stamps. There are 11 stamps in total, showing the people who have played the role of the Doctor in earlier episodes. Matt Smith plays the 11th Doctor in the new series of Doctor Who from 2010. At the age of 26, he is the youngest actor to play the Doctor.
Doctor Who's 50th Anniversary Special, which began filming in April, will be broadcast in 3-D around the show's birthday in November. The programme's special 50th anniversary story is still a secret. Steven Moffat, the show's lead writer, says the script (剧本) is “on my computer under lock and key.” And the current Doctor Who star Matt Smith says fans “will not be disappointed” by the 3-D show. “It's going to be the biggest， and best, and most inventive (富有创造力的) and most exciting year for the show,” he added.
Are you excited about the special episode?
