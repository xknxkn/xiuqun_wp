            	<![CDATA[
Kids in France have their own newspaper made by children and for children. Mon Quotidien, called My Daily in English, is the world's only daily newspaper for kids, and it has been going for 18 years.
This newspaper is aimed at 10 to 14-year-olds. Combined with its sister papers for other age groups, Mon Quotidien sells 200,000 copies every day. Kids get news, pictures, features (特辑，专题) and cartoons from the newspaper, and many of them seem to love it.
To make sure they keep in touch with their readers, the editors are joined twice a week by three kids, who help decide which stories to get into print.
Editor-in-chief (主编) Francois Dufour says the success of the newspaper is down to three things: kids who want to read news, parents who just want kids to read, and teachers who welcome anything they can use in their lessons.
Mon Quotidien has launched three other papers for different age groups: Le Petit Quotidien for eight to 10-year-olds, l'Actu for older teenagers, and most recently Quoti for very young readers.
In fact, Mon Quotidien is one of the few newspapers in France whose sales are not falling.
