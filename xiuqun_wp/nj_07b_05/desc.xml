            	<![CDATA[
Have you heard of 2 Broke Girls (《破产姐妹》)? It is a popular American television sitcom. The show centers on two poor girls.
One is called Max. She comes from a poor working-class family and has been living on her own since she was a teenager. The other one is called Caroline. She was born rich, but has been left with nothing after her father’s crimes (罪行). The two become friends and build toward their dream of one day opening a cupcake shop.
The show not only brings you happiness, but also teaches you some life lessons.
<b><font color='#000000'>Lesson One: We can start over.</font></b>
Sometimes we cannot predict and control what will happen in our lives. When a bad thing happens, we should pick ourselves up, make a new plan to move forward and never look back.
<b><font color='#000000'>Lesson Two: Friends are important.</font></b>
Many people think that money can make us happy, but it is not true. 2 Broke Girls tells us that life’s real treasures are friends. We can have fun without money if we are having a good time with our friends. Money can buy us expensive clothes and big houses, but it cannot buy us happiness.
