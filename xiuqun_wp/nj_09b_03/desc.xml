Lily is going to London during the Olympic Games this summer, but she doesn’t know where to visit. So she wrote a letter to her friend Jenny, who lives in London. Here’s Jenny’s reply.
March 1
Dear Lily,
I’m so excited to hear that you are coming to London this summer! We can watch some Olympic matches together. Besides, I can be your guide and take you to some really interesting places in London.
The first place we should visit is Buckingham Palace (白金汉宫). Built by the Duke of Buckingham (白金汉公爵), it is now the residence (住所) of the Queen of England. Today it houses U.K. government offices and is the site of official events and receptions hosted by the Queen.
The palace contains more than 700 rooms. State Rooms (国事厅), which are for guests, are nicely decorated with treasures from the Royal Collection (皇家珍藏), famous works of art, and fine English and French furniture.
One thing we can’t miss at the palace is the Changing of the Guard. It is a 30-minute ceremony where a new guard exchanges duty with the old guard. A Guards band plays traditional marching songs or even popular music during the ceremony.
I bet you must have heard of the London Eye. How wonderful it is to see the whole of London from more than 400 feet off the ground! Since its opening in 2000 as part of London’s millennium festivities (千禧年庆祝活动), the wheel has won more than 70 honors for tourism, architecture and engineering success.
if it is a clear day, we will see for more than 40 miles from the top of  the wheel, and view such landmarks as Buckingham Palace and St. Paul’s Cathedral (圣保罗大教堂). It is a wonderful view!
You’ve said that you have a great interest in Gothic (哥特式的) architecture, haven’t you? Then you must love Westminster Abbey (威斯敏斯特修道院) a lot! It is a well-known landmark which is more than 700 years old, and it is still an active church.
The abbey hosts such ceremonies as royal weddings, coronations (加冕礼) and funerals. Within it are the tombs of many English monarchs (君王), including Queen Elizabeth I. The abbey’s Poet’s Corner houses the tombs and memorials (纪念碑) of famous English writers, including Charles Dickens and William Shakespeare.
if there are any questions or any other places that you want to visit, write to me.
Love,
Jenny
