Vanda and Linda from Xishuangbanna, Yunnan, were very special contestants at last year's China's Got Talent. The little sisters sang a beautiful song called Endless Flowers, and even had a five-year-old elephant dance for their performance. The song is about their love for the tropical rainforest in their hometown.
People were moved by the song, but the story of the little sisters' family was even more touching.
Linda and Vanda's father was the late (已故的) German biologist and rainforest expert Josef Margraf (马悠). His passion for biodiversity (生物多样性) and the environment began at the age of 18. By 1989, he had succeeded in creating a new way to recover and renew the rainforests, which rewrote the textbooks on rainforest protection in the Philippines (菲律宾). For that he was given a Philippine Presidential Award in 1997. In the same year, he was assigned by the European Union to lead a panel (专门小组) on a rainforest protection project in Xishuangbanna for six years. Eventually Margraf left the panel and decided to rescue the world on his own.
In 2000, Margraf met Li Minguo (李旻果) and they got married soon. Their love for nature brought the couple closer together. They set up Seeds of Heaven &amp; Beyond Biodiversity Development Center (天籽生物多样性发展中心) in Yunnan.
They rented 10,667 square meters of land along the Lancang River (澜沧江，湄公河上游在中国境内河段的名称). During that time, no other people lived within 100 kilometers and the place was wild and remote, ruled by rubber trees previously planted by humans who had left.
They cut down the rubber trees and planted thousands of different plants. Official statistics (数据) showed, in the past 50 years, the temperature difference between seasons in Xishuangbanna has increased while the relative humidity (湿度) decreased. Rubber trees draw great amount of water from underground to make themselves grow, just like a pump (抽水机). No other plant can survive near rubber trees. The rubber industry brings money, but the growth of the rubber has already caused water resources to drop in Yunnan. It also destroys biodiversity. Actually, any single species dominating an environment is a disaster. So there shouldn't be any large-scale (大规模的) single crop industry in the rainforest.
Until his death, Margraf stayed in China to discover nearly extinct species and helped establish a biodiversity system in the rainforest region in Southwestern China. But now it is all up to Li Minguo. "This was a life-subject for Josef. It is a great honor for me," said Li.
