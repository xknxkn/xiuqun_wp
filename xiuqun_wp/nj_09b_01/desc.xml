Mark your calendar for Green Consumer Day, September 28. This day was created with the intention of providing a time to think about our choices as consumers and consider how they could be greener.
Lately, terms such as global warming, recyclable and environmentally friendly, have created a buzz even among common people—thanks to the newspapers and electronic media. So, people are getting more "Green Conscious" than "Brand Conscious," and are voting with their shopping dollars. People are more concerned than ever about the environmental impact of products they buy. Practical consumers purchase those products and packages that can be recycled or otherwise safely disposed of in their communities. 
Green Consumerism (绿色消费主义) has helped spur (刺激) significant shifts in the way in which some industries produce their products. Although green consumers express their environmental concerns in individual ways, they are motivated by universal needs. These needs translate into new purchasing habits—they look at the ways products are developed and marketed. Many industries have realized that it is not easy to meet the appetite of green shoppers. So in turn, they have also started to adopt green techniques.
So, if you are not a green consumer, then Green Consumer Day is the day when you can think and rethink on what you buy, the impact it has on us and on our common environment. We can take our small steps, which would contribute to the bigger cause—Environment Protection. Let's Go Green and make a difference!
