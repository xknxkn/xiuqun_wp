Terra Nova, which literally (字面上) means "new land," is an American science fiction (sci-fi) TV series.
The story is set in 2149, when the world has really modern technology, but overpopulation and declining air quality worldwide threaten all life on earth. People have to walk around with masks over their faces due to the polluted air, and couples are prohibited from having more than two children.
After scientists discover a rift (裂缝) in space time, they begin sending people to the earth's past to save the human race. But the travel is one-way: once a person is sent to the prehistoric (史前的) earth, he can never come back to 2149.
People of 2149 are selected and then go through "pilgrimages (远游)" 85 million years into the earth's Cretaceous (白垩纪的) past.
The Shannon family travel to the prehistoric earth on the tenth pilgrimage. And Jim and Elizabeth Shannon, the parents, manage to take all of their children—Josh, Maddy, and Zoe (the youngest of the family who was illegally born)—to start a new life in the distant past.
People who came before the Shannons have set up a colony (聚居地) as their new home. They call it Terra Nova. 
Terra Nova is a world with fresh air, living trees and lovely sunlight. But the sweet new home is threatened not only by the dominators of the Cretaceous period—the dinosaurs, but also by the Sixers—people who arrived in the sixth pilgrimage.
The Sixers succeed in making time travel back to 2149 possible. They plan to send the natural resources of the Cretaceous earth back to the world in 2149, where there is a severe lack of natural resources. Their evil plan is to make a lot of money from stripping the prehistoric earth of everything valuable. People of Terra Nova are fighting against the plan.
Though Terra Nova is just a sci-fi show, it hints at (暗示，示意) the obvious problems of our time: if we don't stop using up our natural resources so quickly or with no thought of the price it will cost our future, we may really need a Terra Nova, sooner or later.
