Best places around the world that you can't miss—
<b><font color='#000000'>Marseille—France's new capital of culture</font></b>
马赛——法国新兴的文化中心
Cities may rise and fall, but the great ones—and Marseille is among them—always rise again. Founded by ancient Greeks, France's second largest city was already 500 years old and a combination of many cultures when Caesar (凯撒) laid siege (围城) in 49 B.C. 	These days Marseille has every right to act the show-off as it and the surrounding Provence (普罗旺斯) region take up the role of 2013 European Capital of Culture. There is a new energy in the city, especially in music, theater and museums. Marseille's old pleasures remain as atrractive as ever: a walk along the narrow lanes of the Panier Quarter (北非移民区), the aromas of a good bouillabaisse (浓味鱼肉汤), and a boat ride into the inlets (水湾，小港). No wonder visitors are becoming big fans of France's southern gateway.
<b><font color='#000000'>Travel tips</font></b>
When to go: June to August for beaches, April to May and September to October for comfortable temperatures and lighter tourist traffic.
Fun Fact: France's newest national park, Parc National des Calanques (小海湾国家公园), is located on the outskirts (郊区) of Marseille.
<b><font color='#000000'>Raja Ampat—An Eden in Indonesia</font></b>
四王群岛——印尼的海上伊甸园
Raja Ampat is a group of small islands in Indonesia. It has been dubbed the Amazon of the Oceans. Is that hyperbole? Not really.
There are single reefs (礁) here containing more species than the entire  Caribbean (加勒比海). You can meet many interesting and rare sea animals there, such as Raja Ampat's walking shark and pygmy seahorse (豆丁海马), along with more common creatures—manta rays (蝠鲼), leatherback turtles, and bumphead parrotfish (隆头鹦哥鱼). Not to mention coral species.
<b><font color='#000000'>Travel tips</font></b>
When to go: Late September through early June. Be aware that mid-June through mid-September is monsoon season (季风季节), with a lot of rainfall.
Fun Fact: On Raja Ampat's Um Island, bats circle the blue skies by day and seagulls take flight at night.
